# Ben Hernandez's Front-End Project Proposal

## Users and Uses
This project is a fully functional graphing calculator aimed at middle and high
school students who do not have access to a graphing calculator at home but do
have access to a smartphone/tablet or computer.

##Technologies Involved
The project will incorporate:
- the fraction library from http://www.xarg.org/2014/03/precise-calculations-in-javascript/
- the MathJax library for pretty printing https://www.mathjax.org/
- The Math.js library from https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs
- &lt;Canvas&gt; for graphing of functions

Input will be passed from a text box to both MathJax for pretty output and to the Math.js library for evaluation.
Input will update real time so the user gets instant feedback about what they are typing in.

##Features
- Graphing of multiple functions
- Graph window responds to mouse input.
- Graph window automatically resizes for function input.
- Tables of the same above functions.
- Ability to define a function for use later
- Ability to use functions in calculation (i.e. 10 * f(5))
- Pretty print so user is sure they are typing in the equation correctly.
- Ability to handle trig functions in both degrees and radians.
- Formatting of output so user sees both (sqrt(2)/2 and 0.70710678118)
- History of calculation for easy reuse.
- Responsive buttons for non-keyboard use.
